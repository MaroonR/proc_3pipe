# proc_3pipe
3 stage pipelined ISA implemented in verilog implementing
regular ALU functions, branching, vectored interrupts, 
a L1 cache, and data forwarding. 


#To-do
=============
Still need a working compile before debugging can commence
- get ALU attached so that
  - load/alu mux can work
  - immediate/indirect addressing mux can work
